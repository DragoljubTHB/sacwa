	Interactive Digital Television (iDTV) provides a large amount of educational programs useful for supporting students’ learning and teaching processes. Nevertheless, despite the continuous growth of the number of available contents, it is hard to find those which can be useful for a specific educational purpose. In order to provide a solution to this issue, in this paper we propose a model of a semantic Recommender System for educational iDTV programs, in which, the concept of competency and its features have been integrated as contextual information to enhance both the user and program information. Thus, we can establish filtering strategies in accordance with educational requirements. Furthermore, this proposal incorporates ontology-based filtering to enhance the inference capacity of another approaches, such as, content-based, collaborative, and syntactic matching.},
